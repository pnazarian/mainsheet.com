Because of my lack of knowledge of GitHub, there are a few errors in the way I committed the repository.

The google-api-php-client should be contained in the /library directory, but I removed it so the repository would not be
unneccesarily large.

There should be a /images/userImages directory and /pages directory which hold user content, but because these
directories were empty, GitHub did not commit them.

Finally, please bear in mind that this project is a work in progress and there are several areas that are not complete.
